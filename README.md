# Asteroids_2
This game is a new ramped up version of the popular game "Asteroids" developed many years ago. The player plays the role of a starship whose goal is to protect Earth while bringing back resources and money. Further planets from Earth contain more exotic resources, and so, more money. However, resources are not the only goal. The further you move from Earth, the more risks that may come close to it. Also, the starship's fuel must be managed effectively in order to not get stuck in interstellar space...
